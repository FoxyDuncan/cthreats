            <h1>Cyber Security</h1>
            <p>
                Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.

            <h1>Threat Detection</h1>
            <p>
                When it comes to detecting and mitigating threats, speed is crucial. Security programs must be able to detect threats quickly and efficiently so attackers don't have enough time to root around in sensitive data. A business's defensive programs can ideally stop a majority of threats, because often they've been seen before‚Äîmeaning they should know how to fight them. These threats are considered "known" threats. However, there are additional ‚Äúunknown‚Äù threats that an organization aims to detect. This means the organization hasn't encountered them before, perhaps because the attacker is using brand-new methods or technologies.
